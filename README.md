## Getting Started

   Clone this repository to your local machine using:

3. **Open the CV**:

4. **Customize Your CV**: 
   Edit the `src/index.html` file to add your personal information, education, work experience, research, and contact details.

5. **Styling**: 
   Modify `src/css/style.css` to change the appearance of your CV. You can adjust fonts, colors, and layout properties.

6. **Printing**: 
   Use `src/css/print.css` to ensure the CV is formatted correctly for printing on A4 paper. This file includes styles for page breaks and margins.

## Additional Notes

- The `src/js/main.js` file is included for any future interactive features you may want to add, although it is not necessary for a static CV.
- The `assets/fonts/.gitkeep` file is a placeholder to keep the fonts directory in version control. You can add custom fonts here if needed.
